Hi, i'm Kevin!

I'm currently in my third year of studying Computer Science at UNSW.

In my spare time, I enjoy making videos, taking photos and chasing sunrises and waterfalls.

You can find most of my work on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/purplekev/) and my videos on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@purplekev17)!
